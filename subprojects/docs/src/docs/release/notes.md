## Upgrade instructions

Switch your build to use Gradle @version@ by updating your wrapper:

`./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version=@version@`

See the [Gradle 7.x upgrade guide](userguide/upgrading_version_7.html#changes_@baseVersion@) to learn about deprecations, breaking changes and other considerations when upgrading to Gradle @version@.

For Java, Groovy, Kotlin and Android compatibility, see the [full compatibility notes](userguide/compatibility.html).   

## New features and usability improvements

<!-- Do not add breaking changes or deprecations here! Add them to the upgrade guide instead. -->

### FILL-IN-KEY-AREA improvements

<<<FILL IN CONTEXT FOR KEY AREA>>>
Example:
> The [configuration cache](userguide/configuration_cache.html) improves build performance by caching the result of
> the configuration phase. Using the configuration cache, Gradle can skip the configuration phase entirely when
> nothing that affects the build configuration has changed.

#### FILL-IN-FEATURE
> HIGHLIGHT the usecase or existing problem the feature solves
> EXPLAIN how the new release addresses that problem or use case
> PROVIDE a screenshot or snippet illustrating the new feature, if applicable
> LINK to the full documentation for more details

### Wrapper task validates distribution url

The wrapper task now validates the configured distribution url before writing it to the `gradle-wrapper.properties` file.
This surfaces invalid urls early and can prevent IO exceptions at execution time.

More details can be found in the dedicated section of the [Gradle Wrapper](gradle_wrapper.html#[adding_the_gradle_wrapper](sec:adding_wrapper)) user manual chapter.

### Java toolchains discovery progress display

Progress is now displayed during [Java toolchains discovery](userguide/jvm/toochains.html#auto_detection).
This can be useful during a cold-start of Gradle for users who have environments with a lot of JVM installations in them.

### Kotlin DSL improvements

Gradle's [Kotlin DSL](userguide/kotlin_dsl.html) provides an alternative syntax to the Groovy DSL with an enhanced editing experience in supported IDEs — superior content assistance, refactoring documentation, and more.

#### Kotlin DSL reference

A versioned reference documentation for the Gradle Kotlin DSL is now published alongside the user manual.
This reference covers both the Kotlin DSL and the Gradle Java API.

You can use the [Kotlin DSL reference](kotlin-dsl/) search functionality to drill through the available members.

#### Gradle `init` defaults to the Kotlin DSL

Starting with this release running `gradle init` now defaults to generating new builds using the Kotlin DSL.

In interactive mode you can choose which DSL to use and the Kotlin one is now listed first:

```text
Select build script DSL:
  1: Kotlin
  2: Groovy
Enter selection (default: Kotlin) [1..2]
```

See the [build init](userguide/build_init.html#sec:what_to_set_up) user manual chapter for more information.

#### Fail on script compilation warnings

Gradle [Kotlin DSL scripts](userguide/kotlin_dsl.html#sec:scripts) are compiled by Gradle during the configuration phase of your build.
Deprecation warnings found by the Kotlin compiler are reported on the console when compiling the scripts.

It is now possible to configure your build to fail on any warning emitted during script compilation by setting the `org.gradle.kotlin.dsl.allWarningsAsErrors` Gradle property to `true`:

```properties
# gradle.properties
org.gradle.kotlin.dsl.allWarningsAsErrors=true
```

More details can be found in the dedicated section of the [Kotlin DSL](userguide/kotlin_dsl.html#sec:compilation_warnings) user manual chapter.

### Dependency verification keys stripping

PGP keys for dependency verification downloaded from key servers are now stripped to contain only necessary data.
This feature can significantly reduce keyrings size.
